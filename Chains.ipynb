       "AIMessage(content='As President of the Indian National Congress, it\\'s both an honor and a responsibility to remember and celebrate the sacrifices and contributions of those who fought for our nation\\'s freedom. Picking just ten is incredibly difficult, as so many played crucial roles, but I would highlight the following figures, representing diverse ideologies, regions, and contributions:\\n\\n1.  **Mahatma Gandhi:** The Father of the Nation. His philosophy of non-violent resistance, Satyagraha, inspired millions and shaped the course of the freedom movement. His leadership in movements like the Non-Cooperation Movement and the Quit India Movement were pivotal.\\n\\n2.  **Jawaharlal Nehru:** A visionary leader, a staunch Congressman, and India\\'s first Prime Minister. He advocated for a socialist and secular India and played a critical role in shaping the nation\\'s early policies and its foreign policy of non-alignment.\\n\\n3.  **Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel:** The \"Iron Man of India.\" His instrumental role in integrating the princely states into the Indian Union post-independence cannot be overstated. He was a pragmatic leader and a key figure in the Congress party.\\n\\n4.  **Subhas Chandra Bose:** A charismatic leader who believed in a more assertive approach to achieving independence. He formed the Forward Bloc and later the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army), demonstrating the desire for freedom resonated even amongst those who sought alternative paths.\\n\\n5.  **Bhagat Singh:** A revolutionary socialist who advocated for complete independence. His acts of defiance and sacrifice, like the bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly, ignited the passion of the youth.\\n\\n6.  **Smt. Indira Gandhi:** While her primary role was post independence, her own lineage as the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru and her dedication to the Congress party cannot be overstated. She was a freedom fighter in her own right.\\n\\n7.  **Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:** A social reformer, jurist, and the architect of the Indian Constitution. His fight against social injustice and his advocacy for the rights of the marginalized communities were integral to the freedom struggle. He also had his own political party but was an invaluable contributor to the freedom movement.\\n\\n8.  **Maulana Abul Kalam Azad:** A prominent leader of the Indian National Congress and a staunch advocate for Hindu-Muslim unity. He was a scholar and a powerful voice against communalism.\\n\\n9.  **Sarojini Naidu:** The \"Nightingale of India.\" A poet, activist, and a prominent figure in the Congress party. She played a crucial role in the Civil Disobedience Movement and was a powerful voice for women\\'s rights.\\n\\n10. **Mangal Pandey:** A sepoy in the British East India Company who is widely regarded as a key figure in the events immediately preceding the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\\n\\nIt\\'s vital to remember that this is just a small selection. There were countless others â€“ women like **Rani Lakshmibai, Annie Besant, and Aruna Asaf Ali**; revolutionaries like **Khudiram Bose and Chandrashekhar Azad**; and leaders from diverse backgrounds and regions who contributed to the collective struggle for independence.\\n\\nThe Indian National Congress recognizes and honors the contributions of all those who fought for our freedom. We are committed to upholding the values of democracy, secularism, and social justice that they fought for. We are the custodians of their legacy and it is our duty to carry forward their vision of a united, strong, and prosperous India.\\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'is_blocked': False, 'safety_ratings': [], 'usage_metadata': {'prompt_token_count': 18, 'candidates_token_count': 728, 'total_token_count': 746, 'prompt_tokens_details': [{'modality': 1, 'token_count': 18}], 'candidates_tokens_details': [{'modality': 1, 'token_count': 728}], 'cached_content_token_count': 0, 'cache_tokens_details': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'avg_logprobs': -0.37782337901356455, 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash-001'}, id='run--7227375c-339b-4824-bbf6-87f4f6245dab-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 18, 'output_tokens': 728, 'total_tokens': 746})"

    "The purpose of trigonometry is to study the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles. It's a fundamental branch of mathematics with far-reaching applications in various fields. Here's a breakdown of its key purposes and applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Measuring Distances and Heights Indirectly:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Navigation:** Trigonometry is crucial for determining positions and distances in navigation, whether it's for ships at sea, airplanes in the sky, or even satellite navigation systems. By using angles and known distances, one can calculate unknown distances.\n",
    "* **Surveying:** Surveyors use trigonometry to measure land boundaries, determine elevations, and create accurate maps.\n",
    "* **Astronomy:** Astronomers utilize trigonometry to calculate the distances to stars and planets. Early trigonometric tables were developed for astronomical calculations.\n",
    "* **Architecture and Engineering:** Architects and engineers apply trigonometry to calculate heights of buildings, bridges, and other structures, as well as to determine roof slopes, light angles, and structural loads.\n",
    "* **Geography:** It helps in creating maps and determining distances between landmarks.\n",
    "* **Marine Biology:** Marine biologists use trigonometry to estimate the size of marine animals and understand the depth of sunlight penetration in the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Analyzing Angles and Geometric Shapes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Understanding Relationships in Triangles:** Trigonometry provides the tools to find unknown angles or sides of a triangle when some information is known. This is essential in various geometric and real-world problems.\n",
    "* **Decomposition of Vectors:** In physics and engineering, trigonometry is used to break down forces and velocities into their horizontal and vertical components, making it easier to analyze motion and equilibrium.\n",
    "* **Working with Periodic Phenomena:** Trigonometric functions like sine and cosine are fundamental in describing periodic phenomena such as sound waves, light waves, and oscillations. This is vital in fields like physics, acoustics, and electronics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Applications in Technology and Beyond:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Computer Graphics and Video Games:** Trigonometry is used to calculate angles, distances, and movements of objects in 3D graphics and game development, ensuring realistic motion and interactions.\n",
    "* **Music:** The mathematical relationships behind musical sounds and harmonies can be described using trigonometric functions, particularly sine waves.\n",
    "* **Medical Imaging:** Techniques like MRI and CT scans rely on mathematical principles that involve trigonometric concepts.\n",
    "* **Criminology:** Trigonometry can be used to analyze crime scenes, such as calculating the trajectory of projectiles or the angles involved in collisions.\n",
    "* **Cartography:** The creation of maps relies heavily on trigonometric principles to represent the Earth's curved surface on a flat plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, trigonometry provides a powerful set of tools for understanding and quantifying relationships involving angles and distances. Its applications span numerous scientific, engineering, and everyday contexts, making it an indispensable part of mathematics and its practical uses.\n",
